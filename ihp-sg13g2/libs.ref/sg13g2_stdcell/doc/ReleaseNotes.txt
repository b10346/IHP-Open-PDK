1. Changes for Release:
==========================================================================================
Rev0.1.4: The update includes Liberty models update, verilog models update, small fixes of technology LEF file. Instance names are updated in CDL and spice netlists of standard cells.
Changes:
- Liberty models were re-characterized and regenerated to fix typos in SDF conditions. Values of timing/power can be different due to using of new versions of characterizer and simulator (#650),
- "Cell footprint" attribute is updated to define cell families (#698),
- Test cells function sintax is changed from "`" to "!",
- Attribute "sdf_edges : start_edge" is added to flip-flops to ensure correct SDF annotation and consistensy between STA and gate-level simulation,
- Timing specification sections are updated in Verilog models,
- UDP (user-defined primitives) models are removed from file "sg13g2_stdcell.v" and put to separate file "sg13g2_udp.v",
- Port order of cells in Verilog model is changed to be consistent with CDL and Spice netlists,
- TopMetal1 picth value is changed from 2.28 to 3.28 in technology LEF (#722),
- BUSBITCHARS attribute is aligned to "[]",
- Changed ViaRULE name to viaTop1Array 
- Changed ViaRULE name to viaTop2Array
- Changed ENCLOSURE for Metal5 and TopVia1 to align with DRC rules
- Changed ENCLOSURE for TopMetal2 to align with DRC rule

- CDL views are updated: instances are renamed,
- CDL and spice netlists are re-generated with updated instance names.


Rev0.1.3: !IMPORTANT!: It is strongly recommended to save previous library version for debugging early implemented designs. It is NOT ALLOWED simple cell layout replacement in existing designs. Designs require re-synthesis of layout. 
Changes:
- routing directions of metal were changed to opposite state in technology LEF file: M1(H), M2(V), M3(H), M4(V), M5(H), TM1(V), TM2(H),
- new via definition section is implemented in technology LEF file: set of vias is minimized, layout of vias is simplified,
- 6 new standard cells were added in the library (scan and non-scan flip-flop functionality is aligned) to enable DFT flow: 
	sg13g2_dfrbpq_1
	sg13g2_dfrbpq_2
	sg13g2_sdfrbp_1
	sg13g2_sdfrbp_2
	sg13g2_sdfrbpq_1
	sg13g2_sdfrbpq_2,
- all cells were re-characterized (Liberty/verilog models were updated and set of power arcs was optimized),
- layout of cell sg13g2_tiehi is modified to add metal contacts to substrate,
- the cell sg13g2_sdfbbp_1 is obsolete, it is not recommended to use.
- the library contains 84 cells instead of 78.


Rev0.1.2: !IMPORTANT!: It is strongly recommended to save previous library version for debugging early implemented designs. It is NOT ALLOWED simple cell layout replacement in existing designs. Designs require re-synthesis of layout.

- M2 was removed from following cells:
	sg13g2_buf_16 area: no changes
	sg13g2_dfrbp_1 area: new value is 52.6176 um2
	sg13g2_dfrbp_2 area: no changes
	sg13g2_ebufn_4 area: new value is 27.216 um2
	sg13g2_inv_16 area: no changes
	sg13g2_slgcp_1 area: no changes

- Cell sg13g2_sdfbbp_1 is not changed full re-design required
(will be re-designed). sg13g2_dfrbp_1 cell requires area optimization. It will be done together with scan flip-flop re-design.

- Layout cleanup was provided for most of all cells (contacts alignment and pin placement optimization). 

- Multiplier m=1 for all transistors, NG parameter is used now in CDL and schematics. 

- Schematics inhereted bulk connection are drawn with the same stile.

- List of updated views: CDL, GDS, LEF, Liberty (cells area updated only), schematics, layouts and abstracts.


Rev0.1.1: Layout and LEF of some cells were updated to fix abbutments DRC errors.

Rev0.1.0: VSS and VDD are defined as global nets with inherited connection. LEF was updated
          with this change. Liberty models and datasheets were regenerated, standard cells
          were re-characterized with updated QRC tech file and 'buf_1' active driver setting
          for all input pins.
          Library cell functions were tested by schematic vs liberty and verilog vs liberty
          validation test.
Rev0.0.4: Bug of function definition in a22oi cell is fixed. Vr1 and Var2 attribute of sdfbbp
          cell are corrected. Verilog, LIB are changed.
          Datasheets for the fixed cells will be updated in the next full library recharacterization.
Rev0.0.3: dffp2 cell was updated. CLK pin is available.
Rev0.0.2: 11 new cells were developed for the library. Layout and CDL updates were provided
          for whole library. All views were regenerated.
Rev0.0.1: Initial version of sg13g2_stdcell digital standard cells library for SG13G2 technology.
